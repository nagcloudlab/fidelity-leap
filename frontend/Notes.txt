UI -> data + style + interactvity
Web UI -> HTML + CSS + JS

why do we need javascript for HTML-pages?

using browser's Api(s), javascript can bring interactivity to HTML pages. 

 browser's Api(s) -> w3c recommended standards -> DOM, XHR/Fetch, etc.
 Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

 browse's vendor ( e.g., Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) 
 implemeted these Apis navely ( c++ ) and expose them to JS as global objects (e.g., document, window, etc.)
 

using DOM Api
---------------
-> to Create/Update/Remove HTML elements
-> to change CSS styles
-> to react to user interactions (clicks, form submissions, etc.)

using XHR/Fetch Api
-------------------
-> to fetch data from servers asynchronously (without reloading the page)

using setTimeout/setInterval
-------------------
-> to execute any action on timeout/interval (e.g., auto-saving, animations, etc.)

problems working browser's Api(s) directly
---------------------------------
1. Browser compatibility issues: Different browsers may implement APIs differently, leading to inconsistent behavior across platforms
   https://caniuse.com/
2. Verbose and complex code: Working with browser APIs directly can lead to verbose and complex code, especially for common tasks like DOM manipulation and event handling
3. Performance issues: Directly
4. Memory leaks: Improper use of browser APIs can lead to memory leaks, especially when dealing with event listeners and DOM manipulation
5. Security vulnerabilities: Improper use of browser APIs can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other forms of injection attacks
6. Code reusability: Directly working with browser APIs can lead to code that is tightly coupled to specific implementations, making it difficult to reuse code across different projects or platforms

Solution: Using Server-page technologies 
           -> jsp,thymeleaf, etc. (Java)
           -> ejs, handlebars, etc. (Node.js)
           -> Razor (ASP.NET)
           -> php, etc.
           -> jinja2 (Python)

Limitations of Server-page technologies
---------------------------------

-> on every page response, browser needs to reload the entire page, 
   which can lead to slower performance and a less responsive user experience
-> server need to maintain the state of the application, which can be complex and error-prone, especially for larger applications   
-> increase n/w traffic, as the entire page needs to be sent from the server to the client on every request, even if only a small portion of the page has changed
-> limited interactivity, as server-side rendering can make it difficult to create dynamic and interactive user


best solution: using client-side page technologies 
--------------------------------------------------

-> Jquery

MVC based client-side framework
------------------------------

-> knockout.js
-> backbone.js
-> ember.js
-> dojo
-> Ext.js from sencha ( commercial )
-> AngularJS ( Google )
....


Component-based client-side framework
------------------------------
-> React ( Facebook )
    -> Next.js ( Vercel )
-> Angular ( Google )
-> Vue.js ( Evan You )
-> Svelte ( Rich Harris )
-> Solid.js ( Ryan Carniato )


----------------------------------


component => data ( .html ) + style ( .css ) + interactivity ( .ts )


---------------------------------


Angular core concepts
-----------------


1. Data Binding

 1. interpolation ( one-way data binding )
      syntax: {{ expression }}
  2. property binding ( one-way data binding )
      syntax: [property]="expression"
  3. event binding ( one-way data binding )      
      syntax: (event)="handler($event)"
2. Directives

   1. structural directives ( *ngIf, *ngFor, etc. ) => to change component's structure ( add/remove elements )
   2. attribute directives ( ngClass, ngStyle, etc. ) => to change component's appearance ( add/remove classes, change styles, etc. )
